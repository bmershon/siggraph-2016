\begin{abstract}
	\textbf{S}pecial \textbf{I}nterest \textbf{G}roup on computer \textbf{GRAPH}ics. The following is based on the experience of a 22 year old Student Volunteer (SV) attending the 43rd SIGGRAPH Converence on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques for the first time. The conference is held in the Anaheim Convention Center for six days in July, 2016. Following graduation and the beginning of an exciting new job on the SketchUp team at Trimble, this student booked a ticket from Boulder to Anaheim, checked in with an Airbnb host to avoid incurring the cost of a hotel, and joined other accepted SVs from across the country and overseas who had all been tasked with ensuring that the week-long event runs smoothly (and having fun in the process).
	
	This is my little story about how I heard of SIGGRAPH, why I applied to be a student volunteer (get in for free!), how I got there, what it was like, and what I learned. It's my story, but I wouldn't have minded reading someone else's when I was in my senior year of college, trying to evaluate all of the information and opportunties demanding my attention. As I see it, there are three purposes my account of SIGGRAPH 2016 should serve. First, it should let you know what SIGGRAPH is so you can decide if it is something you would like to attend in one capacity or another. Second, it should also help shed some light on the rhythm of the event and highlight for other participants, especially other SVs, aspects of the conference which they might like to focus on (including what goes on \textit{around} the conference). This isn't a list of dos and don'ts, just what I saw that was interesting, which was certainly affected by my SV role, my housing accomodations, and the current stage of my education and career. Lastly, the following lets me reflect on why this young whippersnapper went to an academic conference on graphics and what the experience taught me; that's certainly worthwhile for me and you are welcome to skip around or stop reading now.
